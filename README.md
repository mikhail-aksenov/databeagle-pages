## Databeagle project

This project is a research project focused on data quality control and visualization.

### Rationale

The data is a mess. Business losts a lot of money due to poor data quality on the whole lifecycle from acquisition to retention. A goal of this project is to order the mess a bit. And the first step is to tame OPC datasources which are de facto standtard of industry.
